# üîç Sign-Up Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Sign-up is not working at all. This could be due to several issues with Clerk configuration.

## ‚úÖ FIXED: Email Verification Flow
The sign-up now properly handles email verification:

1. **User fills sign-up form** ‚Üí Clerk creates user
2. **Email verification required** ‚Üí User enters verification code
3. **Verification complete** ‚Üí User is signed in and redirected to onboarding

## ‚úÖ FIXED: "Already Signed In" Error
**Issue**: After email verification, you might see "You're already signed in" error.

**Cause**: Clerk automatically creates a session after successful email verification, but our code was trying to create another session.

**Solution**: The code now checks if a session was already created and handles the "already signed in" case gracefully.

## Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Clerk Test Screen
1. **Run your app**: `npm start`
2. **Go to the Clerk Test Screen** (automatically redirected)
3. **Check the status**:
   - If it says "Clerk is loading..." and never changes ‚Üí **Invalid publishable key**
   - If it says "Clerk is loaded but user is not signed in" ‚Üí **Clerk is working, try sign-up**

### Step 2: Check Console Logs
Look for these logs when trying to sign up:
```
SignUp Screen - Clerk State: { isLoaded: true/false, signUpAvailable: true/false, setActiveAvailable: true/false }
Starting sign up process...
Creating user with Clerk...
Sign up result: { status: 'missing_requirements' }
Preparing email verification...
```

**After verification**:
```
LOG  Attempting email verification...
LOG  Verification result: { status: 'complete' }
LOG  Verification complete, checking for session...
LOG  Session automatically created: sess_...
LOG  Session set active, redirecting to onboarding
```

### Step 3: Test Email Authentication
1. Click **"Test Sign Up"** button on the clerk-test screen
2. Fill in the form and try to sign up
3. **Check your email** for verification code
4. **Enter the code** in the verification screen
5. Check the debug info on the sign-up screen

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Invalid Publishable Key
**Symptoms**:

   publishableKey="pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY_HERE"

### Issue 4: "Already Signed In" Error
