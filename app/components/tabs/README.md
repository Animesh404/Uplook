## üöÄ How to Activate These Tabs

```typescript
<Tabs.Screen
  name="plans"
  options={{
    title: "Plans",
    tabBarIcon: ({ color, focused }) => (
      <Ionicons
        name={focused ? "calendar" : "calendar-outline"}
        size={24}
        color={color}
      />
    ),
  }}
/>

<Tabs.Screen
  name="review"
  options={{
    title: "Review",
    tabBarIcon: ({ color, focused }) => (
      <Ionicons
        name={focused ? "star" : "star-outline"}
        size={24}
        color={color}
      />
    ),
  }}
/>
```

### Option 2: Move Files to (tabs) Directory
Simply move the files from `app/components/tabs/` to `app/(tabs)/`:
```bash
mv app/components/tabs/plans.tsx app/\(tabs\)/
mv app/components/tabs/review.tsx app/\(tabs\)/
```
