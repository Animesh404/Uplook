## Overview
This document outlines the improved integration between the welcome screen and authentication flow to provide the best user experience for the Uplook wellness app.

## New User Flow

  - Manual navigation with Previous/Next buttons
  - Skip option for users who want to go directly to auth
  - Beautiful gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
  - Progress indicators showing current step

### 2. Auth Selection Screen

## Returning User Flow

  - No welcome screen interruption

### 2. Automatic Routing
- **Signed in + Completed onboarding**: → Main app (`/(tabs)/home`)

- **Not signed in**: → Auth screen (`/auth`)

## Onboarding Integration

### 1. Onboarding Flow
- **Location**: `/app/onboarding/`
- **Steps**: 3-step process (personal info, goals, reminders)

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **Welcome Screen Status**: Stored in AsyncStorage as `welcome_seen`

### Routing Logic
```javascript
// In app/index.tsx
if (isSignedIn && hasCompletedOnboarding && user) {
  router.replace('/(tabs)/home');
} else if (isSignedIn && !hasCompletedOnboarding) {
  router.replace('/onboarding/one');
} else if (!isSignedIn && !hasSeenWelcome) {
  router.replace('/welcome');
} else {
  router.replace('/auth');
}
```
