## 📊 Data Flow

### Plan Creation Process
1. User completes onboarding with selected goals
2. `PlanService.create_plans_for_user()` creates plans for each goal
3. Each plan gets populated with relevant content from database
4. Content is scheduled using spaced repetition algorithm

### Home Screen Data
1. `GET /home/agenda` fetches user's personalized agenda
2. Returns today's activities from active plans
3. Includes suggested content based on user goals
4. Frontend renders with appropriate UI for each content type

### Content Consumption
1. User taps activity from home screen
2. Navigates to `/content/[id]` with content ID
3. Dynamic content viewer renders based on content type
4. Completion tracking updates user streaks and plan progress
